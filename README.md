# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
  An analysis was performed on employee data from Pewlett-Hackard to determine the number of retiring employees by their title, and to identify the number of employees eligible for the companies mentorship program. This will help the company determine how many and what type of positions will need to be filled in the near future as well as how to best mentor and train the new incoming employees. 
## Results
  After completing the analysis, the results found are as followed:
  1. From the Unique_titles csv we are able to see a comprehensive list of the name of each employee set to retire soon as well as their most recent position title.

## Summary
Pewlett-Hackard should expect to lost over 70,000 employees due to the "silver tsunami" of retirement in the upcoming years. Since only about 1,500 employees are eligible for the mentorship program, they will likely need to fill over 60,000 positions in the next 5-10 years. From the above table of elibile mentors, we can see that there are not quite enough elibilge mentors to compensate for the amount of employees that this company will be losing. While the mentorship program should make an impact, the company should also prepare for how to quickly fill the positions they will be losing with the best possible candidates.
